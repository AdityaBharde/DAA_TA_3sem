#### Q.3) Implement the Multistage Graph Algorithm in any programming language on a graph with total number of nodes=14

#### Problem Explanation
A **multistage graph** is a directed acyclic graph where nodes are organized in stages. The algorithm finds the minimum cost path from a source node to a sink node. This problem can be solved with dynamic programming by working backward from the sink node.
